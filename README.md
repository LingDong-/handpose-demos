# Handpose Demos

![](images/icon-handpose.png)

Collection of minimalistic demos/templates using [mediapipe handpose with tensorflow.js](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/03/face-and-hand-tracking-in-browser-with-mediapipe-and-tensorflowjs.html). Created for and supported by [the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry](https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/).

> The handpose package detects hands in an input image or video stream, and returns twenty-one 3-dimensional landmarks locating features within each hand. Such landmarks include the locations of each finger joint and the palm. -- blog.tensorflow.org

There are 4 templates included in this repo, 2 of them with [three.js](https://threejs.org) and 2 with [p5.js](https://p5js.org), 2 are multiplyer via socket.io + express, and 2 are singleplayer static sites. They're all well commented and explained for beginners.

All demos are hosted on [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) üéè

# Facemesh Demos

![](images/icon-facemesh.png)

Collection of minimalistic demos/templates using [mediapipe facemesh with tensorflow.js](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/03/face-and-hand-tracking-in-browser-with-mediapipe-and-tensorflowjs.html). Created for and supported by [the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry](https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/).

> The facemesh package infers approximate 3D facial surface geometry from an image or video stream, requiring only a single camera input without the need for a depth sensor. -- blog.tensorflow.org

There are 4 templates included in this repo, 2 of them with [three.js](https://threejs.org) and 2 with [p5.js](https://p5js.org), 2 are multiplyer via socket.io + express, and 2 are singleplayer static sites. They're all well commented and explained for beginners.

## Keypoint Subsets

There're 3 additional keypoint subsets available in each demo to select from, as alternatives to the facemesh 468 vertices. See image below for indices and triangulation for each of them:

![](images/facemesh-subsets.png)

From left to right:

- Minimal 7 points
- Important features 33 points
- Standard facial landmark 68 points
- Full facemesh 468 points. A larger resolution and flattened version of the illustration is available in [tfjs facemesh repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/facemesh).
